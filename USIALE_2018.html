    As you have seen so far, Tangible Landscape represents the landscape as a projection-augmented model which is perceived in a bird’s-eye perspective.
    So it is not capable of fully representing the real-world experience of geospatial feature or phenomenon, in the way that we perceive it in human view.

    ! And thats why Tangible Landscape with VR !

    The idea was to generate a georeferenced 3D model of the under-study model,
    in which all the features and behavior of 3D elements like trees, buildings and surfaces are linked to their corresponding tangible object in
    tangible landscape. In this way, as users manipulate the tangible model and pieces, they can see, in real time, the changing landscape rendered on display or through virtual reality headsets like oculus.
    Additionally, we wanted to empower users to control the camera and animation so they can step into and navigate in their desired location in the landscape.

<h2>How it works ? </h2>

<img class="stretch" src="img/New_setup.png">

    <aside class="notes">
    For implementing the concept, we added a 3D modeling and game engine software, called blender,
    to the tangible landscape setup with outputs to a display and an immersive virtual reality headset.

    What is Blender? Why Blender?
    Blender is a free and open source program for modeling, rendering, simulation, animation, and game design.
    The software has an internal python-based IDE and add-ons for importing GIS data to georeference the scene, and displaying the viewport in HMDs.
    It also allows realtime high-quality rendering and shading.

<!-- --SLIDE 16--Software Architecture -->
<section>
<h2> Software Architecture </h2>
<img class="stretch" src="img/Coupling_diagram.jpg">

    <aside class="notes">
    Briefly describing the workflow, GRASS GIS and Blender are loosely coupled through file-based communication. As user interacts with the tangible model or objects, GRASS GIS sends a copy of the geo-coordinated information or simulation to a specified system directory.
    We implemented a monitoring module in blender scripting environment that constantly watches the directory, identifies the type of incoming information, and apply relevant operations needed to update the 3d model. The input data can range from geospatial features like a raster or a point cloud, simple coordinates as a text file, or signals that prompt a command such as removing an object from the scene.
    </aside>

<!-- --SLIDE 18--Landforms -->

<section>
<h2> Landform and water </h2>
<img class="stretch" src="img/coupling_case.jpg">
<!-- <video data-autoplay  width="800" src="img/water2.mp4" frameborder="0"></iframe> -->

   <aside class="notes">
    Now lets see how some of the landscape features are processed through the application.
    For example, when landscape is manipulated with hand, a geotiff raster and a polygon related to water is processed.
    As users carves the landscape, Water flow and accumulation simulations are continuously projected onto the physical model.
    Numeric indicators about the depth and surface area of the retained water is projected.
    At the same time, point-cloud and water polygon is transferred to blender update the 3D model.
   </aside>

</section>

<!----SLIDE 19-- Plant species -->
<section>
<h2> Vegetation  </h2>
<img class="stretch" src="img/coupling_case2.jpg">

  <aside class="notes">

  Users can design tree patches using colored felt pieces. They can either draw and cut their prefered shapes using scissors, or select from a library of cutouts with various shapes.
  Each color represents a landscape class based on National landcover datast classification, like decidous, evergreen etc. For instance in this example green denotes evergreen class and
  eastern pine trees, red means decidous and red maple, blue represents wetland species and river birch.
  Grass GIS applies image segmentation and classification to the scanned image to assign RGB values to their corresponding landscape classes.
  Using landscape structure analysis we compute and project various metrics related to landscape heterogeneity, biodiversity and complexity,
  which as you can see is projected below the landscape model.

  After importing, Blender applies a particle system modifier to populate corresponding species in each patch based on a predefined spacing and density,related to each specie.
  Some degree of randomness is applied to the size, rotation and sucsession of species to mimic the realworld representation of a patch.

  </aside>

<!-- --SLIDE 20-- Trails, features -->
<section>
<h2> Paths </h2>
<img class="stretch" src="img/coupling_case3.jpg">

 <aside class="notes">
 (Show the trail and wooden cubes.)
 Additionally users can uses tangible objects, in this case wooden cubes to designtate a pathway, in this example a baord walk.
 As user inserts each of the chekpoints, Grass GIS, recalculetes and projects an optimal route using an algorithm that computes the least cost walking path.
 A profile of the road and the slope of the segments are projected as feedback (show them).

 Additionally, the polyline feature is processed in Blender as a walktrough simulation that can viewed on screen or in HMD.

 </aside>

</section>

<!----SLIDE 21-- Human-views -->
<section>
<h2> Cameras </h2>
<img class="stretch" src="img/coupling_case7.jpg">

 <aside class="notes">
   The 3D model is interactive so anytime during the interaction users can freely navigate in the environment and explore diffrent vantage points using the mouse.
   But we wanted to keep that feature interactive as well. We used wooden marker with colored tip, that denotes the viewers location and direction of view.
   The feature is exported as a polyline feature. Once imported in blender, The scene camera is then relocated to the line’s starting point and the direction of view is aligned to the line’s endpoint.

</section>

<!----SLIDE 22 immersion-- -->
<section>
  <h2> Immersion </h2>
   <video data-autoplay class="stretch"  src="video/immersion.mp4" frameborder="0" loop="loop"></iframe>

<aside class="notes">
Using a virtual reality addon, blender viewport is continuously displayed in both viewport and headmounted display,
so users can pick up the headset and get immersed in their prefered views.
One additional camera is also set to follow the imported trail feature to initiate a walkthrough animation if required.

Optionally, user can manipulate degree of realism. We assigned each 3D feature from the sky to the trees to a low-poly counterpart.
Both low-poly models and blender scene are rendered in realtime and update almost instantly.
